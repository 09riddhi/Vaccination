Vaccination Sentiment Analysis
This project is all about understanding how people feel about vaccination by looking at their tweets. Using some NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques, I cleaned the data, processed the text, and built models to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

What’s inside
Vaccination_Analysis.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis and code
vaccination_tweets.csv → Dataset of vaccination-related tweets

Tools & Libraries
Python (Pandas, NumPy) → data handling
Matplotlib & Seaborn → visualizations
Scikit-learn → machine learning and text vectorization
NLTK → text cleaning and preprocessing

What I did
Cleaned and prepared the tweet dataset
Explored the data and visualized trends
Converted text into features using CountVectorizer / TF-IDF
Built machine learning models to classify sentiments
Looked at the results and insights
