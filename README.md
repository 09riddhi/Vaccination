Vaccination Sentiment Analysis:

Vaccines have been one of the most talked-about things in the last few years, especially during the pandemic. On sites like Twitter, millions of people shared their thoughts, whether they were good, bad, or neutral.
Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques, this project looks at those tweets to figure out how people feel about getting vaccinated.

Structure of the Project:
Vaccination_Analysis.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook with the code and analysis broken down into steps.
vaccination_tweets.csv → A set of tweets about vaccinations that are used for training and testing.

Tools & Libraries Used:
Python → core programming language
Pandas & NumPy → data cleaning and manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn → data visualization and insights
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) → text preprocessing (stopwords, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization)
Scikit-learn → vectorization (CountVectorizer, TF-IDF) & machine learning models

Project Steps:

1. Data Preprocessing :
eliminated stopwords, extraneous characters, and punctuation.
Normalized text and missing values were handled.
Analysis of tokenized tweets

2. Analysis of Exploratory Data (EDA) :
Analysis of word frequency (common words in tweets that are positive or negative)
Sentiment distribution visualization
N-gram analysis of frequently used phrases in tweets

3. Extraction of Features :
Text was transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization and Bag of Words.

4. Model Construction :
Machine learning models (SVM, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression) were implemented.
Compared the performance and accuracy of various models

5. Findings & Perspectives :
determined the general sentiment patterns regarding vaccinations.
determined which terms or expressions were most closely linked to favorable or unfavorable opinions.
